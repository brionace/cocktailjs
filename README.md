# cocktailjs export

This folder is an export of the assets and build tooling for glasses and garnishes.

Next steps:

1. Create a new git repo (cocktailjs) and copy these files into it, or push this folder as the initial commit.
2. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build` to verify the package builds.
3. Update CI to publish the package (or deploy assets to a CDN).
